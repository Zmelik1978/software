
INSTRUCTIONS FOR LAUNCHING

1. Create an empty folder named ReadibilityText on your computer's Desktop.
2. Download the ReadibilityText.py script into this folder.
3. In this folder, create another folder named after the author.
4. Place TXT files containing the author's texts into this folder. Each work should be in a separate TXT file. The encoding must be UTF-8.
5. Run the ReadibilityText.py script, e.g., in VS Code.
6. A GUI window with two input fields will appear.
7. In the first input field, enter the absolute path to the ReadibilityText directory. You don't need to modify slashes—just copy the path from the folder properties.
8. In the second input field, enter the name of the subfolder where the TXT files with the author's works are stored.
9. Press Submit.
10. Depending on the size of the subfolder, 4 graphs will be generated after a short time, displaying the following readability measures:
	- Flesch Reading Ease
	- Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
	- Gunning Fog Index
	- Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Flesch Reading Ease
11. The ReadibilityText folder will be updated with:
	- TXT files containing individual metric values.
	- A table summarizing all readability scores along with text length details.
